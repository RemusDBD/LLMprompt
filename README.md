## Q&A

- [BeYourOwnTeacher](https://github.com/RemusDBD/LLMprompt/blob/main/Q%26A/BeYourOwnTeacher.md): Generate question based on your provided content. Good for self-learner with any book/studies resource. Try to mix with different summary tools and study tools (e.g Anki) for maximum result. It also works well with transcript.
